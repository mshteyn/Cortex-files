VC++ written for the Cortex environment. Cortex is a software environment for running behavioral and neurophysiological experiments originally developed at the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH).

The primary file is the timing file (extension ".TIM"), which controls experimental variables like which visual cue appears on a monitor and when with millisecond precision. The code is also designed to respond dynamically to behavior variables like inputs from an eye tracking system or neurophysiological events. 
The items file ".ITM" and conditions file ".CND" are referred to by the timing file and are used to organize individual trials and sensory stimuli.
